<h4>Assignment 1: Make a Box</h4>
The first assignment of this week was to create a shoebox-sized box out of cardboard using the laser cutter. Navigating Fusion was extremely tricky for me, as the main difficulty for me was simply learning how to use it. I also encountered the obstacle of the lines of my sketch being unconstrained, which I couldn't really figure out why (to this day...). I followed Nathan's tutorial thoroughly but it was just not really working for me, so I ended up redoing the same design 3 times to not have the unconstrained lines. 
<br></br>
Customizations: For my box, I decided to add a lid and tab that I have attached velcro to, so that the contents of my box will not fall out. I also wanted to engrave a picture of a bird and the words "The box of Jolee Kuo". The bird was engraved properly, but I accidentally mirrored the words, so they are backwards. I decided not to re-cut the box just for the words because I think it is a waste of material for such a small detail. My box also didn't fit exactly (it came close!), but I had a hard time navigating the kerf, so I decided to just hot glue some parts together for extra stability. It doesn't look perfect, but I like the way it turned out! I also ended up adding a vinyl sticker of a raven on the lid of the box.
